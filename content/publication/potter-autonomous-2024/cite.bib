 abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of an autonomous robotic system for disaster mapping and victim localization. Using a Turtlebot3 with ROS Noetic, the system generates comprehensive maps and identifies victims in closed, unknown environments. It incorporates a Cubature Kalman Filter for AprilTag localization and an information-theoretic exploration algorithm to expedite exploration. The system demonstrates robustness and agility, making it suitable for real-world search and rescue missions.},
