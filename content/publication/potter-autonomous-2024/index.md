abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of an autonomous robotic
  system for disaster mapping and victim localization. Using a Turtlebot3 with ROS
  Noetic, the system generates comprehensive maps and identifies victims in closed,
  unknown environments. It incorporates a Cubature Kalman Filter for AprilTag localization
  and an information-theoretic exploration algorithm to expedite exploration. The
  system demonstrates robustness and agility, making it suitable for real-world search
  and rescue missions.
