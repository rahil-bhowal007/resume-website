  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
Hi! Iâ€™m Rahil Bhowal, a Masterâ€™s student in Robotics at Northeastern University, Boston, with a concentration in Computer Science. My passion lies in leveraging robotics to explore and navigate complex environments, from underwater domains to on-ground terrains.

Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work with diverse robotic systems, including Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), Turtlebots, and Moorebots. During my masterâ€™s journey, Iâ€™ve delved deeply into robotic perception and explored the coordination of multiple robots for collaborative exploration.

With my skills and experience, I aspire to push the boundaries of robotics and contribute to its transformative impact on the world.
